      "complicated by massive blood loss of 1.7 liters\n",

      "of her bleeding, but was found to have elevated LFTs (AST250\n",
      "ALT291 AP350 TBili 10.6 and INR 3.6) as well as rising\n",
      "creatinine. She was resuscitated with multiple blood product (2\n",

      "further recovery with a tentative diagnosis of fatty liver of\n",

      "with worsening LFTs, and large transfusion requirements. The\n",
      "Acute Care Surgery Service was consulted, at which point she was\n",
      "noted to have an extremely distended abdomen with bladder\n",
      "pressures greater than 50 mmHg. Her Cr had improved from her\n",
      "intraoperative values, but she continued to have a rising\n",
      "lactate (5.4), evidence of end organ dysfunction (hypotension)\n",
      "and rising peak inspiratory pressures. A diagnosis of abdominal\n",
      "compartment syndrome was made and the patient taken to the\n",

      "good blood flow to your coronary arteries (the blood vessels\n",

      "initially started on levofloxacin for empiric coverage for a\n",
      "pulmonary infection. Later that day his antibiotic coverage was\n",
      "increased to vancomycin and cefepime. The following morning he\n",
      "became hypoxic after eating/drinking. A respiratory code was\n",
      "called. He was satting well on a non-rebreather. The decision\n",
      "was made to intubate on the floor to prevent further\n",
      "decompensation. After intubation, multiple secretions/food were\n",
      "suctioned from his airway. He was transferred to the ICU for\n",
      "further care. His antibiotic coverage was broadened to\n",
      "vancomycin and zosyn. The following day his blood pressures\n",
      "began to decrease. He was started on norepinephrine,\n",
      "phenylephrine, and vasopressin. He received several fluid\n",
      "boluses. On [**7-6**] micafungin was added for fungal coverage due to\n",
      "persistent fevers. MRSA grew from BAL sputum on [**7-4**] and on\n",
      "subsequent sputums on [**7-6**] and [**7-7**]. On [**7-7**] Zosyn was\n",
      "discontinued. Meropenem and linezolid were started based on ID\n",
      "recommendation. His primary source was felt to be from MRSA\n",
      "pneumonia. The infectious disease team followed his course and\n",
      "offered recommendations. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation,\n",
      "multiple pressors, and appropriate antibiotic coverage, he had\n",
      "signs of end organ damage. An echo showed an EF of 15%, he had\n",
      "elevated LFT's, elevated lactate to 12.1, increasing coags and\n",
      "decreasing platelets indicating DIC, increasing WBC, and\n",
